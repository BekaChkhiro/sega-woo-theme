#   2. Run: npm run build
#   3. Upload the entire theme folder to Hostinger via FTP/File Manager
#   4. Run: wp acorn optimize (via SSH or WP-CLI)
#
# Important paths on Hostinger:
#   Theme: /public_html/wp-content/themes/[THEME_FOLDER]/
#   Assets: /public_html/wp-content/themes/[THEME_FOLDER]/public/build/
#
# The manifest.json in public/build/ maps source files to hashed output files.
# Acorn reads this manifest to load the correct versioned assets.
